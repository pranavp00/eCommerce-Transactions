# eCommerce Transactions Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to extract actionable insights, recommend similar customers using a lookalike model, and segment customers into meaningful clusters. By leveraging data science techniques, the project aims to enhance business strategies and improve decision-making processes.

## Dataset Overview

The project utilizes three key datasets:  
1. **Customers.csv**: Contains information about customers, including their unique IDs, names, regions, and signup dates.  
2. **Products.csv**: Provides product details such as unique IDs, names, categories, and prices.  
3. **Transactions.csv**: Includes transaction records, associating customers with products, transaction dates, quantities, and total values.

## Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   Analyze the datasets to identify trends, patterns, and relationships that can drive business decisions.  

2. **Lookalike Customer Recommendation**:  
   Develop a recommendation model to find customers with similar profiles and transaction histories.  

3. **Customer Segmentation**:  
   Cluster customers into distinct groups based on their profiles and purchasing behaviors, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
